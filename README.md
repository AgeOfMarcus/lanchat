Possibly my most horribly written piece of code ever. I wrote it in a hurry cause I was meant to be doing my homework but I got a good idea.

It uses my [pynodes](https://github.com/AgeOfMarcus/pynodes) library to discover peers and be able to be discovered. Communications via flask apis and async i/o in terminal.

Just figure it out.
